OBJECTS:

     Objects are important data types in Javascript.
     Objects are different than primitive datatypes,for example:number,string etc..
     Primitive data types contain one value but objects can hold many values in form of key:value pair.
     These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods.
     Every object has some property associated with some value.
     
Eg: var mybike=new Object();
     mybike.make='suzuki';
     mybike.year=2001;
     mybike.wheels=2;

     The value inside the Object can be accessed using keys.
     i.e,
           mybike.year
          
           output:2001
